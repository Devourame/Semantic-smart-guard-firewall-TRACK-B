# SmartGuard Semantic Firewall - Track A

## Overview

SmartGuard is a hybrid AI guardrail system designed to detect and block:

- Jailbreak prompts
- Prompt injection attacks
- Toxic or harmful instructions
- Indirect adversarial prompts
- Semantic bypass attempts

Instead of relying only on static keyword filtering, SmartGuard combines:

- Rule-based detection
- Semantic similarity analysis
- Intent analysis
- Pretrained moderation transformers
- Threshold-based risk scoring

to produce a final SAFE / UNSAFE verdict.

# Why We Chose Track A

During development, we experimentally explored lightweight fine-tuning using DeBERTa-v3-small on adversarial datasets.

However, due to:

- limited development time
- constrained compute resources
- limited high-quality labeled adversarial data
- insufficient attack diversity

the fine-tuned model showed weak generalization and unstable performance on unseen jailbreak prompts.

Under these constraints, a hybrid Track A architecture using semantic analysis and pretrained moderation models produced significantly more reliable and stable real-world performance than both:

- pure keyword filtering
- small-scale custom fine-tuned models

# Final Conclusion

Experiments showed that:

- Pure keyword filtering is highly vulnerable to paraphrasing and indirect attacks
